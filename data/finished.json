Focusing on representative texts that define and redefine the medium, we will learn how to approach comics as a distinct literary and visual form, while familiarizing ourselves with the critical vocabulary of \"sequential art.\" By examining the graphic novel with an eye toward the literary, the course will explore a variety of genres and the ways they deploy conventional literary forms such as allegory, epic, character, setting, symbolism, and metaphor. We will consider how comics resist, represent, and entrench dominant cultural ideologies about power, myth, heroism, humor, adolescence, gender, sexuality, family, poverty, religion, censorship, and the immigrant experience. The course will provide students with the critical tools to read this key vehicle of contemporary creative expression. Readings will include seminal works and newer classics, by Gaiman, Bell, Miller, Moore, Crumb, Bell, Spiegelman, Ware, Derf, and shorter pieces by many others. In addition, we will read selections from texts on graphic narrative theory and comics history, beginning with Scott McCloud\\'s Understanding Comics. Students must attend the first lecture.

Prerequisites: Instructor\\'s permission. (Seminar). This course of distinguished poetry about warriors and warfare goes to the intersection of disciplines, where warrior and poet together compete and excel--ingeniously, formally, passionately, consequentially--as allies in dire contest against annihilation and despair. Homer\\'s&#160;<em>Iliad</em>&#160;heads our list of exemplary titles selected from ancient and classical, mediaeval and early modern sources, including, among others, Sophocles\\'&#160;<em>Ajax</em>, and&#160;<em>Philoctetes</em>;&#160;<em>Beowulf</em>;&#160;<em>Song of Roland</em>;&#160;<em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em>;&#160;<em>The Tale of the Heike</em>; Shakespeare\\'s&#160;<em>Henry V</em>; and Milton\\'s&#160;<em>Paradise Lost</em>. We also will read histories, memoirs, oratory, and guidebooks, from Yuzan\\'s&#160;<em>Budoshoshinshu</em>&#160;to General Patton\\'s \"The Secret of Victory,\" from Vegetius\\'&#160;<em>De Re Militari</em>&#160;to U.S. Army Field Manual (FM) 6-22. Our reading is historically broad enough to prove the range of virtues, precepts, codes and rules of martial character and action. Yet our poetry also excels in vision and in virtuosity quite apart from how it might cultivate the norms of ariste\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xada, chivalry, or bushido, so that certain of our questions about form and style or imaginative effects might differ in kind from other questions about the closeness or disparity of the practical warrior and the poetic warrior, and the extent to which the latter elevates and inspires the former\\'s conception of himself in times of war and peace. We shall consider how battle narratives which excel as poetry and ring true for the warrior, appealing to his wit and outlook, might replenish the aggrieved and battle-weary mind; how a war poem\\'s beautifully formed and lucidly rendered chaos remembers and regains for him the field of action. Toward my interest in the range of possibilities for military literature as a discipline of study, I welcome not only the novice whose interest is avid but the student knowledgeable about military topics in literature, history, political and social philosophy, and especially the student, who, having served in the Armed Forces, can bring to the seminar table a contemporary military perspective and the fruits of practical wisdom.&#160;<strong>Application instructions</strong>: E-mail Professor Giordani (mg2644@columbia.edu) with the subject heading \"Poetics of Warrior seminar.\" In your message, include your name, school,']","semester":"20173","courseName":"POETICS OF THE WARRIOR","department":"English and Comparative Literature</a>","subject":"English"},{"sectionkey":"CPLS3959","courseID":"UN3959","instructors":"['Gayatri C Spivak', '  Mamadou Diouf']","semester":"20173","courseName":"PAN-AFRICANISM&POSTCOLONIALISM;","department":"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for</a>","subject":"Comparative Literature and Society"},{"sectionkey":"ENGL3984","courseID":"UN3984","instructors":"['Maura L Spiegel']","semester":"20173","courseName":"POLITICS&AMERICAN;

familiarize participants with current issues in US and international economic policy development; (2) to better understand the interplay of domestic and international political factors that influence public sector decision-making, and (3) to improve skills for drafting memoranda and making presentations to senior policymakers. The class will focus on domestic and international economic policy issues in which the US has played a significant role, or has a substantial interest. It will focus on topics that arise in a variety of contexts: unavoidable issues with looming deadlines; managing to avoid a potential crisis; and affirmative initiatives where policy leaders choose an objective to advance. Discussions will put class participants in seats at different policy tables, and memos will reflect these varying perspectives.&#160;<strong>Instructor permission required.

human rights. Through student education, skills training, and collaborative, rigorous and self-reflective project work, students will learn to be strategic and creative advocates in partnership with NGOs and communities, while advancing business and human rights methodologies and scholarship. The Clinic is also a laboratory for testing and modeling new and innovative modes of business and human rights work, with a focus on enhancing human rights methods through interdisciplinary partnerships. Our subject for 2015-2016, investment chain mapping, is a cutting edge, highly technical skill taught nowhere else and with strong career potential. Through direct contact with the Client, Inclusive Development International, and its international and local partners, and through possible site visits, the Clinic will provide a unique opportunity for students to acquire the skills to put into practice an innovative and timely advocacy approach to holding transnational corporations and development finance institutions accountable for human rights harms.

Through student education, skills training, and collaborative, rigorous and self-reflective project work, students will learn to be strategic and creative advocates in partnership with NGOs and communities, while advancing business and human rights methodologies and scholarship. The Clinic is also a laboratory for testing and modeling new and innovative modes of business and human rights work, with a focus on enhancing human rights methods through interdisciplinary partnerships. Our subject for 2015-2016, investment chain mapping, is a cutting edge, highly technical skill taught nowhere else and with strong career potential. Through direct contact with the Client, Inclusive Development International, and its international and local partners, and through possible site visits, the Clinic will provide a unique opportunity for students to acquire the skills to put into practice an innovative and timely advocacy approach to holding transnational corporations and development finance institutions accountable for human rights harms. This expertise will position them strongly to become leaders in the field. In future years, the Clinic will continue to engage in projects at the cutting edge of the evolving business and human rights field, as it aims to establish successful long-term relationships with clients. <strong>Instructor permission required for registration.

play in many parts of our lives such asmental health, social relationships, and decision making. The readings will incorporate a wide array of tools that scientists have adopted to understand emotions at different levels of analysis, such as the use of physiological measures (including brain activity), behavioral measures, self-reports of experience, and data acquired through social media.To present different perspectives on the study of emotions, the course will cover research drawn from such fields as social psychology, clinical psychology and developmental psychology, as well as social and affective neuroscience. Concurrently, we will hone a scientific mindset by approaching readings, presentations,and writing assignments with a structured approach to scientific inquiry that helps us identify the major components of the research process when reading and thinking about scientific research.

formations of gender, sexuality, and power as they circulate transnationally, as well as transnational feminist movements that have emerged to address contemporary gendered inequalities.

And, if power swirls everywhere, how are transnational power dynamics reinscribed in gendered bodies? How is the body represented in discussions of the political economy of globalization? These questions will frame this course by highlighting how gender and power coalesce to impact the lives of individuals in various spaces including workplaces, the home, religious institutions, refugee camps, the government, and civil society, and human rights organizations. We will use specific sociological and anthropological case studies, to look at how various regimes of power operate to constrain individuals as well as give them new spaces for agency.This course will enable us to think transnationally, historically, and dynamically, using gender as a lens through which to critique relations of power and the ways that power informs our everyday lives and identities.&#160;  ', '']","semester":"20173","courseName":"GENDER &amp; POWER TRANSNATL PERSP","department":"Women's and Gender Studies","subject":"Women's Studies"},{"sectionkey":"AMST3930","courseID":"UN3930","instructors":"['Hilary-Anne Hallett']","semester":"20173","courseName":"TOPICS IN AMERICAN STUDIES","department":"American Studies","subject":"American Studies"},{"sectionkey":"WMST4310","courseID":"GU4310","instructors":"['Irena Klepfisz']","semester":"20173","courseName":"CONTEM AMER JEWISH WOMEN'S LIT","department":"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard","subject":"Women's Studies"},{"sectionkey":"WMST6001","courseID":"GR6001","instructors":"['Prerequisites: introductory class in gender or sexuality studies, or introduction to human rights.
